                <h1>First Day at Dwarka Campus</h1>
            </center>
            <p>
               On my first day, I visited campus via metro as it was the only convince by which I can reach to college. I read the book given by college, it was kind of manual or in layman terms a kind of code of conduct. I was excited because I was going meet all those people, with whom I interacted during online classes and did not know their faces. 
               As I was reading book, the metro reached to <i>Dwarka </i> station, it stayed for 2-3 minutes there and began to move in reverse direction, it was quite shocking for me, because I might get late on that day, and when I reached <i>Dwarka Mor </i>station I left metro, changed the platform, and went to platform for <i>Dwarka</i> .
               I was carrying, mini drafter in my hands and bag on my back. An old man was looking at me, and I looked at him, asked him about the metro to <i>Dwarka Sector 21</i>. He told me that there are two routes, one is to <i>Dwarka</i>  only, and other is to <i>Dwarka Sector 21</i>. The name of the train get mentioned on the board. So, it would not be the problem. 
               <small>After a minute or 2,</small> metro reached to the station, and we went inside. Then, we began to talk. He asked me about my course. I told him that I am a <strong><em>Computer Engineering Student</em></strong>, and it was my first day of College. At <i>Dwarka Sector 10</i>, I found many students of my course there, we left for college, and stood outside for few minutes at college, because it was not opened then. 
                Then, I went inside the college, teachers introduced themselves to us, and it was our first <b>offline class</b> of <em>Engineering Drawing</em>. 
                Later, we went to library to get books from there.
                Our day, ended with <em>IT Skills and Technology</em> class, and we left the college at <del>5 PM</del> <ins>4:30 PM</ins> in evening.

<p>But, if you write it as <del>H<sub>2</sub>O</del> H<sup>2</sup>O, it will read as H square O</p>
